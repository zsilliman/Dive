//  This is the most important class in this demo.  This class manages the
//  gameplay for this demo.  It is a relativeluy simple class as we are not
//  worried about collisions.
//
//  WARNING: There are a lot of shortcuts in this design that will do not adapt
//  well to data driven design.  This demo has a lot of simplifications to make
//  it a bit easier to see how everything fits together.  However, the model
//  classes and how they are initialized will need to be changed if you add
//  dynamic level loading.
